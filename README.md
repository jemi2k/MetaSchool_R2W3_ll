# MetaSchool R2W3 Cohort ll | Weak 1 

This is the first week of Metaschool R2W3 Code Camp 1, focusing on Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum and Sepolia networks. WAGMI!
It comes with a sample contract, and a script that deploys that contract and interact with contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js --network sepolia
```
